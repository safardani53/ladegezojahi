And being the supportive Father, Jeff allowed his son to pursue whatever he wanted.</p><p>Consequently, the New York native started playing high school football for John Burroughs High School, where he honed his skills and abilities.</p><p>Eben was so impressive during high school that he was awarded the Co-Lineman of the Year and was selected for the All-State Second Team.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/britton-019.jpg><p>Similarly, the offensive tackler’s college career was just as impressive. To illustrate, while playing for the University of Arizona, Eben established himself as one of the best pass protectors in college football.</p><p>Also, Britton was selected for the All-American and All-Pac-10 Conference during his college years.</p><p>Furthermore, he led the nation’s right tackles in blocking consistency ratings.</p><p>When the New York native finished his college career, scouts and coaches saw Eben as one of the top prospects in the 2009 NFL Draft.</p><h2>Eben Britton: Career</h2><p>Britton’s professional journey started with the Jacksonville Jaguars in the 2009 NFL Draft.</p><p>The Jaguars drafted Eben as the 39th overall pick, but the New York native was not happy with being a second-round pick and vowed to prove his doubters wrong. Britton stated,</p><h4><strong>“I’m gonna work my hats off for the Jacksonville Jaguars and people are gonna regret it. I’ve got my agenda, and that’s the first and foremost to take the Jacksonville Jaguars to the Super Bowl. Secondly, I’m gonna be the greatest offensive tackle to ever play the game.”</strong></h4><p>Subsequently, staying true to his words, Eben performed exceedingly well as he started in 15 games in his rookie season.</p><p>Unfortunately, the New York native did not play in the fourth week due to an injury sustained on his knee during a game.</p><p>After that, Britton started his second season in the NFL promisingly, as he started the first seven games.</p><p>It seemed like the player was going through the worst injury run of his career as he sustained another injury that kept him out until the end of the season.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/britton-020.jpg><p>To explain, the offensive tackle dislocated his shoulder in a game against Kansas City, which required three doctors to pop it back in.</p><p>Continuing with the trend, Eben got injured again, and this time, it happened during the pre-season of the 2011 season.</p><p>As a result, his appearances and performances were well below his standards.</p><p>As the saying goes, “Just when you think things can’t get any worse, it does.” Likewise, Britton’s time with the Jacksonville Jaguars went from bad to worse.</p><p>During the start of the 2012 season, Eben suffered an ankle injury that resulted in him missing the beginning of the 2012 season.</p><h4><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Keith Tkachuk Bio: Net Worth, Salary, Age, Career, Stats, Kids Wiki >></a></strong></h4><p>Consequently, the New York native lost his place as he started only five games of the 11 he played.</p><p>Subsequently, the Jaguars traded the offensive tackle to the Chicago Bears, primarily because of his recurring injuries.</p><p>The 6-feet-6 offensive tackle started his time with the Bears by signing a one-year contract.</p><p>Surprisingly, Eben stayed injury-free for the first time in his career as he played in 13 games, mainly as a sixth eligible lineman.</p><p>However, like multiple times before, Britton sustained another injury even before the start of the preseason. This time it was Eben’s hamstring that let him down.</p><p>As a result, the Bears released the New York native only to re-sign him a week later.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/britton-021.jpg><p>Subsequently, the 6-feet-6 offensive tackle appeared in 10 games but did not start any of them. Also, Eben missed another five games due to appendix surgery.</p><p>Even though Britton was one of the Bears roster’s best players, his miserable injury record prevailed in his on-field performances.</p><p>Consequently, the Bears decided not to renew Britton’s contract due to his injury proneness.</p><h4><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tyson Fury Net Worth: Bio, Fight Purse, Business, Cars, Wife Wiki >></a></strong></h4><p>After that, the New York native tried to resurrect his career by visiting several sports doctors.</p><p>Ultimately, Eben decided to retire from sports at just 26 years old as it was taking a lot of toll on his body and his family.</p><p>In conclusion, Britton was one of the best offensive tackles in the league whenever he played.</p><p>But, due to his woeful injury record, the New York native could never reach the heights expected of him.</p><h3>Eben Britton Hotboxin: <a href=#>Mike Tyson</a></h3><p>After his NFL retirement, Britton has engaged in various business endeavors. However, his most successful work has to be the Hotbox.</p><p>To explain, Hotboxin is a podcast radio show where <strong>Tyson</strong> invites a host of celebrities and shares their personal stories with the audience.</p><p>On 17 August 2019, one of the greatest boxers of all time, <a href=#><strong>Mike Tyson</strong></a>, co-hosted the show with Eben to talk about medical marijuana.</p><p>Being cannabis activists, Eben and Mike shared some beautiful stories about how marijuana helps recover from injuries.</p><p>Also, they talk about the side effects of the medicines available in today’s world and how cannabis can replace those medicines.</p><p>However, Eben left the podcast after stating that it showed a hint of changes after Tyson involved a new production crew.&nbsp;</p><h2>How old is Eben Britton? Height & Body Measurements</h2><p>Having been born in the year 1987 makes the current age Eben 33 years. Some might be surprised that Britton is already retired from the NFL due to his young age.</p><p>However, the dangers of American football are there for all to see, as many retired NFL legends are suffering from various mental diseases.</p><h3>How tall is Britton?</h3><p>Eben is a giant man standing at 6 feet 6 inches and weighing 140 kg (308 lb), which helped him become one of the best offensive tackles in the league.</p><p>His bulky and muscular frame and his tall height made even the bravest of opponents quake in their boots.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/britton-023.jpg><p>Besides, the New York native was also one of the quickest offensive tacklers in the league, as suggested by his pre-draft measurables, where he ran a 40-yard dash in just 5.14 seconds.</p><p>But, due to various injuries and illnesses, Britton could only manage six seasons in the NFL.</p><p>However, one also needs to think about their life after their playing career. Thus, I fully support Eben’s decision to retire at the young age of only 26.</p><h3>Eben Britton with foods</h3><p>Besides gyms and heavy workouts, Eben is indulged in meditation. He also has a separate routine for it.</p><p>Well, for his body, he also has his diet plan and has discussed which foods are to eat and which are not.&nbsp;</p><p>According to Britton, some of the foods he keeps away are processed or mutated foods and anything that comes in a box.</p><p>He also stays far away from refined sugar, seed oil, and genetically modified organisms. As he says, these foods cause a significant inflammatory response.&nbsp;</p><p>Moving on to the food he matches is green leafy vegetables, fruits, healthy fats, animal proteins, and other carbohydrates.&nbsp;</p><h2>Eben Britton: Net Worth & Salary</h2><p>As of 2020, Britton has a net worth of <strong>$5 million</strong> accrued thanks to his NFL salaries and post-retirement business endeavors.</p><p>The offensive tackle played in the NFL for six seasons, earning <strong>$5.2 million</strong> in wages.</p><p>Likewise, Eben’s best season in terms of earnings was during his rookie season. For instance, Eben&nbsp;earned <strong>$2.2 million</strong> for his first year in the NFL.</p><p>On the contrary, the New York native pocketed a lot less during his final season in the league due to his recurring injuries.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/britton-022.jpg><p>To be precise, Britton earned a mere <strong>$561,000</strong> in the final year of his professional career with the Chicago Bears.</p><p>In addition to his playing career, Eben is also a strong advocate of medical cannabis use, as it helped him during his playing career.</p><p>Therefore, the New York native has expanded his business to the medical cannabis industry through which Britton earns a considerable sum. All in all, he is enjoying his life even after retirement.</p><h2>Eben Britton: Family & Kids</h2><p>The New York native is happily married to his beautiful wife, <strong>Brittany Britton</strong>. Likewise, the couple had been in a long relationship, which started during their high school days, before their wedding.</p><p>Furthermore, the pair tied the knot in a lavish wedding in the presence of all their family and friends.</p><p>However, there is not much information regarding their marriage or their personal life, for that matter.</p><p>Nevertheless, we do know that the two lovebirds solidified their marriage with the arrival of their daughter.</p><p>But, sadly, not much is known about the child either. I guess the Britton family wants to keep their personal life extremely private.</p><p>Contrarily, Eben and his family often hang out together and post pictures of their beautiful time together.</p><p>Also, Britton is a genuine human rights activist and thus takes his daughter to various rallies to <span>teach her about society’s problems.</span></p><p><span>In conclusion, the Britton tribe is one small happy, and caring family, as they are always there for each other no matter the circumstances.</span></p><h2>Social Media Presence</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a>: 19,300 followers</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a>: 2,555 followers</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook</a></p><h2>Eben Britton: FAQs</h2><p>What are Eben Britton’s bench press record and 40-yard dash time?</p><p>Eben Britton’s bench press record is 24 reps, while his 40-yard dash time is 5.14 seconds.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmionJbGpr7Sm6CoZpOkunCxwZ6lZpqinsG1u81mmaKnXaOytXnWqKmtoF2dvLWuzrGgp2WnnrOmeceeoKCgpGLAorjAq7Bmr5mgtnA%3D</p></content><div></div><section class=sk3-margin-v-full><section class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h"><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><sk3-social><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=%2feben-britton-bio-net-worth-hotboxin-wife-height-salary-wiki.html&title=Eben%20Britton%20Bio%20%5b2023%20Update%5d%3a%20Net%20Worth%20%26amp%3b%20Wife" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"LinkedIn","width=640,height=480,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#linkedin"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2feben-britton-bio-net-worth-hotboxin-wife-height-salary-wiki.html&description=Eben%20Britton%20Bio%20%5b2023%20Update%5d%3a%20Net%20Worth%20%26amp%3b%20Wife" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Pinterest","width=800,height=720,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#pinterest"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2feben-britton-bio-net-worth-hotboxin-wife-height-salary-wiki.html&title=Eben%20Britton%20Bio%20%5b2023%20Update%5d%3a%20Net%20Worth%20%26amp%3b%20Wife" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Reddit","width=832,height=624,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#reddit"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//t.me/share/url?url=%2feben-britton-bio-net-worth-hotboxin-wife-height-salary-wiki.html&title=Eben%20Britton%20Bio%20%5b2023%20Update%5d%3a%20Net%20Worth%20%26amp%3b%20Wife" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Telegram","width=800,height=600,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#telegram"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//twitter.com/intent/tweet/?url=%2feben-britton-bio-net-worth-hotboxin-wife-height-salary-wiki.html&text=Eben%20Britton%20Bio%20%5b2023%20Update%5d%3a%20Net%20Worth%20%26amp%3b%20Wife" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Twitter","width=800,height=450,resizable=yes,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#twitter"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//vk.com/share.php?url=%2feben-britton-bio-net-worth-hotboxin-wife-height-salary-wiki.html" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"VK","width=640,height=480,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#vk"/></svg></a></sk3-social></div></div><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><div class=sk3-margin-h><h3>Jenniffer Sheldon</h3></div><div class="sk3-margin-h sk3-margin-down">Update: 2024-10-08</div></div></div><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><a class="sk3-margin-h txt-center-h" href=./jaicy-elliot.html><h3>&lt;&lt; Fame | Jaicy Elliot net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</h3></a><a class="sk3-margin-h txt-center-h" href=./ariana-madix-feels-a-little-empathy-for-raquel-post-reunion.html><h3>Ariana Madix Feels a 'Little' Empathy for Raquel Post-Reunion >></h3></a></div></div></section></section><div></div></div></div><footer class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h sk3-margin-v-full sk3-pad-v-full"><div class="sk3-pad-h txt-center-h">©
