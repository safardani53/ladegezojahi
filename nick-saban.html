The only two games that the Rockets lost were by a low margin.</p><h3>Cleveland Browns</h3><p>After Saban resigned as Toledo’s head coach, he joined as the Cleveland Browns’ defensive coordinator under its head coach, <a href=#>Bill Belichick</a>.</p><p>Saban continued in the position for four seasons before moving on to Michigan State. When asked about his time at the Cleveland Brown, Nick Saban explains those times as</p><p>“the worst four years of my life”</p><h3>Michigan State</h3><p>Nick Saban coached the team of Michigan State University from the season of 1995. They had not won any season after 1990, so there was a lot of hope from Saban to improve this drought.</p><p>The NCAA also sanctioned the team for violations of the rules while recruiting under its former coach, George Perles.</p><p>Post Saban, Spartans immediately saw an improvement in their games as he took them into the bowl games in each of his first three seasons.</p><p>In 1998, the Spartans miffed the No.1 ranked Ohio State Buckeyes with a 28 – 24 at the Ohio Stadium.</p><p>Even after a fantastic match and early-season rout of then-highly ranked Notre Dame, the Spartans finished 6 – 6.</p><p>This was mostly because of the last-minute losses, defensive lapses, and special terms misplays and failed to earn a bowl invitation. The 1999 season was a good one for the Michigan State Spartans.</p><p>They played the season at 9 – 2, which consisted of wins against teams like Notre Dame, Michigan, Ohio State, and Penn State. The two losses they faced were against Perdue and Wisconsin.</p><p>In the same season, Saban resigned rather suddenly from the Michigan Team to accept the offer for the head coach of Lousiana State University.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Nick-saban-with-Michigan-State-Players-300x169.jpg><p>The Michigan State assistant coach took over Saban’s position for the rest of the season, leading the Spartans to a historic 10 – 2 win at the end of the season.</p><h3>Louisiana State University(LSU)</h3><p>In November of 1999, LSU named Nick Saban as their 31st head coach. The 2000 season was somewhat average for the Tigers.</p><p>They won and lost an overall general amount of games, including losing to the Auburn Tigers and the Florida Gaters.</p><p>Nick Saban led the Tigers to a wonderful season in 2001 with a 10 – 3 record. They won an SEC championship and a Sugar Bowl.</p><p>They lost to the University of Mississippi, but apart from that, the Tigers had six straight wins, including winning against a #2 Tennessee and Illinois in the 2002 Sugar Bowl.</p><p>It was the first SEC championship for the Tigers after 1986 and the first Sugar Bowl since 1968.</p><p>Despite having high expectations for the 2002 season, the Tigers failed to hit the benchmark several times. They made rebounds in the midseason, but an injury to their star quarterback Matt Mauck.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Nick-Saban-300x192.png><p>This caused the Tigers to lose four of the last six matches that kicked them out of the SEC championship. The 2003 season started on a better note.</p><p>The Tigers won the first five games and impressively won against the defending SEC Champion and then-undefeated Georgia Bulldogs.</p><p>The Tigers went on to win the SEC West by losing only to Florida in the process.</p><p>Saban led the Tigers to defeat the Georgia Bulldogs again and went on to play the #1 Oklahoma Sooners in the Sugar Bowl.</p><p>Moreover, they were also the host of the BCS Championship Game. The Tigers won the game as well as the title.</p><p>The 2004 season was mixed with wins and losses. The Tigers won a few matches and lost a few. Nick Saban left LSU in 2004 to serve as the head coach for the Miami Dolphins.</p><h3>Miami Dolphins</h3><p>Nick Saban accepted the head coach position for Miami Dolphins on Christmas 2004.</p><p>The first season under Saban was a whirlwind one for the Dolphins. They had a fantastic start but went on to lose matches after matches before finally winning the streak again.</p><p>The Dolphins missed the playoffs by a narrow margin in the first season under Saban’s coaching.</p><p>In the 2006 season, the Dolphins were expected to make it to the playoffs, but they put up a disappointing game that season.</p><p>They bought an injured player and lost a few games but returned from it and won four games back to back and made it into the Superbowl.</p><p>This was the first losing season for Saban after being the head coach. Rumors that Nich Saban will be the head coach of the University of Alabama began circulating in the Football world.</p><p>While Saban repeatedly refused to talk about it, he later confirmed that he would not be joining the University of Alabama in 2006.</p><p>Nick Saban met with the officials of the University of Alabama in January 2007. This was after the season-ending loss of the Miami Dolphins.</p><h3>University of Alabama</h3><h4>2007 – 2008 Season</h4><p>The Tide(University of Alabama) saw significant changes from their otherwise subpar performances. The team completed the season undefeated for the first time in Saban’s career as a coach.</p><p>In the 2008 issue of Forbes, Nick Saban was on the front cover of Forbes magazine as “The most powerful coach in Sports.” The Crimson Tide went into a winning streak under Saban.</p><p>They won against strong contenders like Clemson Tigers, Arkansas, Georgia Bulldogs, Kentucky Wildcats, and the Ole Miss Rebels, etcetera, and became the number 1 team.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Nick-Saban-3-300x235.jpg><p>The Crimson Tide secured its first SEC Western Division Championship after 1999 and fixed its name in the 2008 SEC championship game.</p><p>Likewise, they finished their regular season with a win against the state rival Auburn.
