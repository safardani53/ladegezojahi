Here we dive into his career details.</span></p><h3><span>High School Football</span></h3><p><span>He initially considered playing college baseball, but he blew out his knee, after which his prospects changed. He became a quarterback as a junior in 1995.</span></p><p><span>However, he was not your typical quarterback; he was skinny and shorter than the usual quarterbacks. But his arm was the hero; when he made a pass, it flew straight and hard to the receiver.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Untitled-design-19.png><p><span>In 1996, during his junior year, he was selected as <strong>Most Valuable Offensive Player</strong>.

However, in his last game, he got injured and tore his labrum.</span></p><h3><span>New Orleans Saints</span></h3><p><span>After the 2005 season, Drew started looking for other teams as he was unsatisfied with San Diego Chargers’ offer. On 14 March 2006, he signed a six-year, <strong>$60 million</strong> deal with New Orleans Saints.</span></p><p><span>He set an NFL record with <strong>5476</strong> <strong>passing yards</strong> in 2011 and a career-best <strong>46 touchdowns</strong>.</span></p><p><span>On 7 February 2010, the New Orleans Saints defeated the Indianapolis Colts <strong>31-17</strong> in <strong>Super Bowl XLIV</strong>.

He was placed on the reserve/retired list on June 11, 2021, by New Orleans Saints.</p><h3>Broadcasting</h3><p>After his retirement from his football career, he immediately joined NBC for the 2021-2022 campaign. As expected, the start of his broadcasting career was a little rough, given his very little experience as an NFL game analyst.</p><p>Amazon and Fox are patting their eye on the former quarterback to include him in their broadcast team.</p><h3><a href=#>Michael Thomas</a> pens down a heart-touching message after Drew’s retirement</h3><p>Thomas himself is known to be the best receiver in the NFL.

In contrast, the actual worth was <strong>$6 million</strong>.</p><p>The couple came across the reality through an independent appraiser, as per the report from the San Diego Union-Tribune.</p><p>According to an earlier complaint, Brees and his wife claimed that the jewelry store owner Vahid Moradi (whom he has stayed in touch with for 15 years and believed him as an expert in valuing diamonds), sold them colored diamonds continually.&nbsp;</p><p>But the jeweler commented that he priced the diamond high as he believed the diamonds could be resold for that price in 10 to 15 years.</p><p>For all that, when the duo removed the diamonds from their settings to prepare them for sale, they understood the settings had been colored to make the stone look more aesthetic.&nbsp;</p><p>However, the couple’s lawyers contradicted his statement and said the diamonds were procured to diversify the Brees investment portfolio.</p><p>And according to CBSNews.com, the San Diego court allowed Brees a <strong>$6.1 million</strong> judgment against the jeweler.</p><h3><a href=#>Brittany Brees</a> stood by her husband through thick and thin</h3><p>Drew Brees’s wife Brittany comes in support of her husband and shares additional injuries her husband went through during the 2020 regular season.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Brittany-talking-about-Drews-injury.png><p>If we have to align through Brittany’s Instagram post, we would clearly get that Drew faces these injuries; <strong>Torn Rotator Cuff (Shoulder)</strong>, <strong>Torn Fascia (Foot)</strong>, <strong>11 Broken Ribs</strong>, <strong>Collapsed Lung</strong>.</p><p>Talking about the whole 2020 season, Drew completed with <strong>2,942 passing yards</strong>, <strong>24 touchdowns</strong>, and <strong>six interceptions</strong> in 12 games.</p><p>While Drew was still recovering from <strong>11 fractured ribs</strong>, he survived Week 10’s victory against the San Francisco 49ers.</p><p>Brittany’s post might be a justification for Drew’s underperformance. We also know he has not notched three interceptions in a game since the 2016 season.</p><p>Additionally, when an athlete goes through a torn plantar fascia, it reduces the ability to plant his feet on passes.
